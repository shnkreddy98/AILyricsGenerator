He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.\\n\\n[Verse 2: JAY-Z]\\nNow, all the teachers couldn't reach me\\nAnd my momma couldn't beat me\\nHard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me\\nSo, with that disdain in my membrane\\nGot on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came\\nThen DeHaven introduced me to the game\\nSpanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now\\nMy gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd\\nAnd all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now\\nMy self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag\\nGot a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged\\nPlus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had\\nSupposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass\\nI'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap\\nBut that came second to me movin' this crack\\n\"Gimme a second, I swear,\" I would say about my rap career\\n'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!\\n\\n[Interlude: Gloria Carter]\\nShawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts.

Jeah!) It's my year, so\\n(Jeah!) It's like the whole Byrd Gang's in here\\nLike Kurt Cobain was here (Jeah! Jeah! Jeah! Jeah!)\\n\\n[Verse 3: Cam'ron]\\nKilla! I'm on the south side of Chicago\\nLooking for a real hoe (Real hoe)\\nI don't see a touchdown; arms up, field goal (Field goal)\\nGot some ill gold, diamonds that's still low (Psh!)\\nLil' dick, you a dickhead, nah, dildo (Dildo)\\nI chill though, pipin' in the Range\\nAll this icin' I'm ashamed, look like lightnin' in the chain\\nWho was first that moved with they fam? (Who?)\\nAsk you: tattoos on they hand (Who?)\\nSlang all the white (Who?), cruise with the tan (Who?)\\nPink on they back (Who?), blue in they band (Who?)\\nYellow on his ear (Who?), steam on the rock (Who?)\\nPurple in the air (Who?), green in his pocket (Who?)\\nI ain't dissing you, dog, I'm dismissing you\\nGet the R. Kelly tape, and see how we piss on you\\nThat's Kool-Aid, Mountain Dew, and Cris' on you (Uh-huh)\\nYour family will be missing you—mwah! There's a kiss for you (Jeah!)\\n[Chorus: Juelz Santana]\\nI'm moving, moving, moving (Jeah!)\\nHe's moving, moving, moving (Ayy!)\\nWe moving, moving, moving (Jeah!)\\nStop moving (Ayy!), shots bruise 'em (Jeah!)\\nTwo more for Cam for taking over the Roc\\n(Jeah! Jeah!) It's my year, so\\n(Jeah!) It's like the whole Byrd Gang's in here\\nLike Kurt Cobain was here (Jeah! Jeah! Jeah!

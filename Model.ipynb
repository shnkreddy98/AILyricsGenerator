        "Before initiating the training process, it is crucial to convert the textual data into a format suitable for numerical analysis. This transformation is facilitated by the tf.keras.layers.StringLookup layer, which can assign a unique numeric identifier to each character in the text. However, it is important to note that before applying this layer, the text needs to be segmented into tokens. Tokenization involves breaking down the text into smaller units, such as individual words or characters, to facilitate more effective numerical representation. Once tokenized, the StringLookup layer can be employed to convert these tokens into numeric IDs, enabling the subsequent training of the model on a numerical dataset."

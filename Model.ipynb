her a bunch of times but she barely replied now its december im driving and shes like wheres my hi its weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summers caught hoin the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowin and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties  yeah man its a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls yknow wanna get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow   forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet since im driving i ask her how to get to the suite she doesnt answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat shes bold but i roll with it im impressed cause shes sweet then she says i heard your song and im obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but im obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good theres a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this im kinda taken back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and its kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin and now my heart attached im thinkin off i shouldve been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho   yeah uh i told yall i had a story for you right uh ya man its what it is  and now im proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench but my boy say im actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone imma hold here down tell everyone im the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and its dallas in this bitch the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for caribana and its a shame she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime   i miss you most of all my darling     give me a second to gather my thoughts strolling in the park ho and watching winter turn to spring such a beautiful day man yeah man you know we had to switch it on em right strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing im still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss man but i got something to else to tell ya baby  i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drakes committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by the end of the week i would know that crew and wed assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different its a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handlin crack is a one man sport instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin the face the breast the bras the toes im still solo and a long night draws to a close cause its a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside well never talk again scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well its like a classified its what im lookin for to carry me through yet i cant seem to find it every girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit and when they talk about they past and lovers and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself now least theres some room to ride theres also room for improvement as soon as june arrive   strolling in the park and watching

            " 'when we hooked up years ago you were supposed to come on the show it didnt happen but we connected the day after and did a legendary interview in hyde park i said it felt like youre gonna make history   its been a while thats kinda how we ended up here when i got here  i was just like in my room just tryna find my lineage of coming to london and just trying to figure out where it all started and i just watched that hyde park interview and im watching this kid its me but to me its just a kid thats just trying to talk trying to answer questions in the best way possible just the fact that we were just walking around just me you a microphone and a camera i was like man i should hit semtex up man we should talk again i feel like that was a good conversation we covered a wide spectrum of things and i think its been a long time since somebodys been able to sit down and do that with me and thats how were here   hows it feel to go from doing mixtapes so far gone was the mixtape that really broke before that lil wayne mentioned you in an interview with me and i started following you and its just grown from there youve been nonstop its crazy   yeah that was an amazing time for all of us still doing it with the same people it was just our landmark for that project is 15 fort york which was 40 and olivers apartment and we really started that project there then it moved to the beverly hills hotel in la when we were first just getting around wayne i know wayne mentioned me in the interview but the real turning point for me was when wayne went on stage at the mtv awards and rapped one of the verses from money to blow instead of doing his own verse he just impromptu rapped one of my verses and at that time people are like people from back home who really didnt i mean it was just a tough thing to believe like i know he says hes over there but is he gonna come home with a lil wayne record is this gonna really happen at that time people were like ok he just rapped drakes song if he gets a wayne record this is outta here that was when i was able to come back off those trips with ransom i went back home with ransom which was the first time i had ever got a lil wayne verse from there i had a bunch of songs that i had recorded at the studio called hot beats and wayne just got on all of them like stunt hard and forever was one of them early early then we started crafting that first project and using the input of two people who again i still work with to this day and my music wouldnt be what it is without them thats oliver and 40  you know its funny cos were sitting here talking and theyre back in toronto executive producing more life olivers executive producing it and 40 is obviously always involved but kinda just a full circle moment for us cos oliver had so much input on so far gone so i was like man it would be nice to do something with me and you again so i gave him that task and hes at home piecing it together so yes it was a great start and from there it just became a wild journey that i guess well talk about   a lot to talk about  more talk since were right at the beginning i was in amsterdam with lil wayneand he tells me  yo hes been writing on detox that was like the mythical album you gotta be about your business to be involved in that or to be in the studio how did you end up from doing a tv show to working with dr dre writing for him on detox its taking it back   its taking it back im not usually that good with the taking it back moments but i actually remember this one vividly but yeah i was on the show and while i was on the show i started getting less and less character time because of the fact that everybody was taking a notice to just the fact that i was more focused on music and at the time i actually had a studio that was right by the film studio for degrassi so i ended up working out a deal with the after hours staff where i would leave work go home get my stuff  degrassi was all the way in the east end which is scarborough thats like an area of our city id go home all the way back to the city get my stuff come back to the studio i would record and around 45am i would sneak back into degrassi theyd let me in and i would go to sleep in my dressing room eventually they found out what i was doing and they got really upset during that time i was crafting all these songs and i had a song that omen produced  it was me and mickey factz and somebody else was on it i think so dre had heard the song and he had hit me like man i need proof that you wrote this laughs so i had to fax him the lyrics of the song i had to send him a fax message from my moms fax machine in her bedroom i sent him a fax  you know at that time detox was going on it was more like he had just a camp of people i guess churning out ideas and just trying to spark something i was flown out to record at record one which is a legendary studio yeah i was in there for a while i did a lot of work me and 40 always brought 40 with me that was like a stipulation in my career i wouldnt move without 40 so brought 40 got to meet a lot of great people obviously got to work with dre and it kinda all came to an end when i dre brought me into his office and said man youre doing really good work and he gave me a 10000 cheque and it was the most money id ever had in my life and at the time i was in a relationship so i got the money and i called my girl and i flew my girl down to la and was like we can get a hotel this is crazy it was just a joyous moment for me and i had missed studio or i had done something wrong i had let my mind deviate from work and i had missed something and next thing i know i was sent home and that was kind of it it was a huge life lesson for me and i still have that actually when dre came out at the forum i brought him the 10000 cheque cos i had saved the actual hard copy of it even though i got the money for it they let me keep a copy of the cheque so yeah that was kinda my dealings with that very early on and i had heard rumblings like oh all these people are here and i had met snoop and i kinda wrote this song that 40 still has somewhere for dre and snoop we listened to it not to long couple years ago its kinda hard but yeah it was a great experience a great learning experience for me and 40 it brought us closer and it just taught us about how this shit really works and i think that set us on our own path  so lets fast forward to 20152016 views one of the most successful albums the tour you did in america was the most successful tours how do you feel about what you achieved with views and the reaction its a very pivotal point for you going from writing for dre and being on a tv show all the way up to    yeah i mean it was one of those moments in my career where the album started to build and build and build and you know when anticipation starts to build it can either result in massive failure or massive success obviously somebodys watching over us and it resulted in massive success for us and it was also just an opportunity for me to really take a lot of risks that i felt i was ready to take at that moment and yeah i mean i was obviously very proud of it from the title to the cover to just the styles of music that i felt we introduced almost as a package it kinda started with work because work came out before my album and then progressed into one dance controlla too good but just the style of music that was making me happy at the time because to be completely honest with you i was having trouble figuring myself out in rap at that time i was a very defensive individual just coming off the situations that id come off of i was having trouble trying to make rap music where i was able to peel back the layers and every time id make a song  40 is always really bluntly honest with me and was like man you really sound like aggressive and defensive  and i was just trying to figure out why and i realised it was just a reaction to my previous situation that had kinda happened before that  so there was a time where i actually thought about taking the rap off of views and just making it an album full of music that made me happy with melody but obviously i know why im here i know who my core fanbase is and so towards the end of the album i tried to execute it as best as i could on the rap end you know i still listen to the bars and i know exactly where i was at and they are great to me and they are time markers to me but yeah i guess well get into more life after and how that situation progressed but yeah views for us was it was surreal the numbers and all the things we were able to achieve it was an incredible time for us and of course in true ovo fashion we didnt celebrate it all we just kinda went on to working on the next thing that was kinda it it was just another album to us it wasnt my biggest album by any means it wasnt the one to me it was just another chapter in the story but im very grateful for the people who enjoyed it and supported it whether people want to admit or not the influence that its had on music i feel is very evident whether people dont wanna say it   did you know what you were doing when you made one dance kylas on there wizkid is on there its a truly global records because i think very few people have done what youve done with mixing everything with the us the uk and african sounds did you know how big it was going to be it was the song of the year   it really all started with the kyla record it was just a song that i had played we dj at our own parties just because    how did you discover it though thats like a uk underground funky sound   i mean i just listen to a lot of music and i have friends with great taste in music so ive been personally putting that song in my own playlist and dj set for like fourfive years now i know its older than that even just playing it and having people what really set something off for me was having people in america come up to me and be like yo what was that song you just played and i would be like man people really like that song but they dont know it so i just my brain started working of like how could i utilise a bit of it theres so many good pieces so i introduced the concept to 85 and i said to him like man if we could make a beat i dont wanna do a cover i wanna write a whole new song i just want kyla to serve as the bridge or as a bridge to the next verse or as a bridge to the next hook and he was like alright alright cool  i had the beat for a while i was just trying to figure it all out and at that time i had met wizkid through skepta cos we did a remix of one of wizkids songs together and it just kinda all really fell into place naturally and when it was all said and done it was one of those moments much like hotline bling i just didnt really know how people were gonna feel about it and that was part of the reason why i dropped pop style along with it cos i was kinda almost nervous like man i dont know this is just so different let me just make sure i drop a rap record so people just know im still on my shit and i remember boi1da had walked into the studio one night and he had heard one dance and he just looked at me and hes like man thats gonna be the biggest song of your career to date and i was like cmon man its like thats a lot to say we hope it does well and yeah he was right and it was just the perfect marriage of a lot of things so many thank yous to kyla for being so supportive she came out to south africa and shot a movie with us for this song and you know of course wizkid doing his thing and yeah just the entire uk for supporting it and the world for being open to listening to it  i love that tempo i love that cadence those melodies thats the music that makes me happy in life so it was great to just be able to just make something like that and shine light on a song from the uk that deserves it because thats truly a classic song   with pop style what happened with that because when i got it originally it was jayz and kanye on it and they kinda werent on it  yeah i was dealing directly with ye and thats the version that he sent me and that was what we talked about and he was like man you know this is like pop style featuring the throne this is huge and i was excited obviously anybody would be excited to see them link back up and then i didnt know what i was gonna hear so when i heard jay had two bars i was like alright it is what it is its cool i like that its a little intro and kanye goes off and then you know im not really sure the details between how that conversation was miscommunicated or what they were going through at that time or what anybody felt towards me or whatever it was im not really sure but next thing i knew it just became a bit of an issue and you know from there i dont waste too much time so i just was like alright cool ill finish it i can rap as good as anybody else so ill just go finish this song and put forth my own version cos i dont really like you know no one can dangle anything over my head in this business i dont play that so it just needed to be done and i did it myself and yeah both versions exist so when kanye comes out to do it at the shows it goes crazy i know he was really upset cos at that time we were working together pretty heavy and he really wanted to be on the record but you know   on the pablo tour he said a lot of things that are well documented but he said before the last show he was talking about how he was sick of not being able to do certain things everyone should come together and just make music is it digital politics now that prevents things from happening   i dont know i think everybody has their own little things going on im not really sure what hes referring to half the time cos in the same breath i went from being like working on a project with him to him sorta publicly shitting on me and dj khaled for being on the radio too much but yeah im not really sure everybodys got their own thing going on again me when i hear that i just distance myself from it you know alright if thats what it is i dont really even understand the point youre trying to make but whatever it is that youre going through i accept it i dont respect it at all you know cos i feel like me and khaled are just good people im not sure why were the target of your choice that you made that night and yeah i accept what youre going through and i just go and continue working on my own thing you know the more and more this progresses the more and more i just feel like keeping to myself cos its just so unpredictable you never know which way people are gonna go i mean streaming is the new record business so yeah i guess you could call it digital politics thats kinda a good name for a song i might have to do that when i get upstairs   so with childs play another banger theres a line on there where you say why you acting light what does that mean   oh you mean im acting like im light skin that line laughs thats just sorta something people thats like very an american thing people say like ah man youre being lightskinned i guess they say its like emotional you know i just think its a ridiculous stereotype but i was just kinda playing on the irony of it cos im actually light skinned so it made me laugh so i said it but yeah its just a silly stereotype in black american culture that lightskinned guys are this way or that way so that was just a little joke   when did you first experience racism youre coming from a dual heritage your fathers black your mothers white it puts you in a predicament when was the first time you really noticed you get it from both sides or one side or the other   man you know ive really been grateful in my life to be born in canada and just the journey that i had growing up was so it was just a very accepting journey i always had friends from all different backgrounds from different walks of life we all get along i never really notice colour religion we dont live like that theres really not that much segregation in canada and especially in toronto its like a cultural mosaic and i know ive said that time and time again but it truly is its made up of so many beautiful people from beautiful places and you get to actually learn and you dont ever develop hate you know the first time i really experienced it was when i got famous and went to america and people would challenge me like i dont understand how it works or like your canadian youll never understand like the black american struggle or youll never under that was the first time i really got challenged and it was by people i had met from america that were like even close to me at the time  you know if i ever feel anything or if i ever feel like an outsider its usually because im not american to be honest with you thats when i feel like people are against me or they feel like im not part of the i guess its got something to do with the fact that i have quite an eclectic make up i am mixed i am jewish yeah but i feel like at the end of the day when it comes to everything else im black i am referred to as a black artist last night at that awards show im a black artist im apparently a rapper even though hotline bling is not a rap song the only category that they can manage to fit me in is a rap category maybe because ive rapped in the past or because im black i cant figure out why just like i cant figure out why one dance wasnt nominated maybe because they cant i mean well its just theres pop obligations that they have and i fluked out i fluked out and got one of the biggest songs of the year that is a pop song and im proud of that you know i love the rap world i love the rap community but youre right i write pop songs for a reason i wanna be like michael jackson i wanna be like artists that i looked up to those are pop songs but i never get any credit to that  and shout out and by the way im speaking to you as a winner from last night i won two awards last night but i dont even want them cos it feels weird for some reason it doesnt feel right to me i feel almost like alienated or youre tryna purposely alienate me by making me win rap awards or either just pacify me by handing me something putting me in that category cos its the only place you can figure out where to put me and remember they dont decide the winners but they do decide the nominations so they have to play it politically and shout out to chance for last night like i said im speaking from a winners point of view and im so happy for him im not talking about im not angry about how last night worked out but when you ask me like where like do i feel like racism or do i feel it the same as everyone else yeah i feel it i notice it going on in its own places but thankfully i get to be around the greatest group of people my friends are from all over the place they like lebenese theyre im jewish most of my friends are from the islands of jamaica english so i mean we just dont really notice it like that until i start talking about the music business  yeah its a really tough time in the world and again that statement has been said over and over again and i think we know its a tough time and im   how did it feel to be on stage in manchester when the grammys were going on you stuck to the tour   yeah i mean i did it because that at the end of the day is what matters to me thats real life you know i was pitched by the grammys to cancel those two shows and fly and go sit in the audience to lose because they dont air the other rap awards on tv so i would have left 30000 people hanging to sit there and just be there for their own ratings you know the worst part is i expressed myself like man im really thankful i was at those shows in manchester cos those were two of the strongest shows that weve had so far i texted somebody from the grammys and was like im really glad i stayed behind i really dont wanna have this conversation about coming out there again and i got a text back that said blame it on donald trump  and im not gonna say who it is that im texting but this is like the institution weve been conditioned to think that this it the true award for our accomplishments for our music by the way if you had a night like chance last night he deserves it for his friends for his family for his collaborators its amazing when they champion you but all im saying is to kids that will be coming up in the future and might now get championed or might not get that moment thats ok too because you have to realise what institution youre dealing with youre dealing with a bunch of people that are just people at the end of the day and theyre either good people to the core or bad people to the core and well never know but i mean yeah i was really glad that i was in manchester last night and like i said im speaking from the perspective of a winner i won two awards its just it really put it all in perspective for that thank god that i stayed here and did what im supposed to be doing for the people that actually care about my music you know yeah man thats just kinda how i feel about that about this given time'\n",

this punk ass little pussys puny neck its my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence but he just displays complete lack of respect thats what he says to himself as he uses his magazines to trash me as he sits with both his feet up at his desk smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin things and he just cant see that hes manically depressed and in his jealousy and envy it just whirls him in a frenzy as he turns on mtv and sees my face he dont exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls spirals and spins til he hurls himself into a rage and its destroyin him slowly cause he does not even know me even though he sees me everywhere he goes so he just tortures himself he has no fortune and wealth so he extorts someone else to get his dough and now hes actin like a bully so he tries to push and pull me but he knows that he cant fool me so hes mad and he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me cause it annoys him to see that i aint scared  you aint no motherfuckin bully and i aint bowin to no motherfuckin bully i wont allow it aint gon cower to no bully ill be damned if i dont stand up to a bully fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully and i know it must be fuckin wit you emotionally   now im not tryin to make no more enemies no more unfortunately theres so many other motherfuckers there just are they just keep houndin at me now that im down with 50 suddenly now i got beef with this faggot ja hahahaha but his ass is such a puppet irv could shove his whole hand up it and just make him say what he wants him to say but suge has irv on a string and irvs so nervous that he says anything to this man to keep him at bay so now ja thinks that hes so tough and murder incs the big bad wolf and they go huff and puff and blow our label down but our buildings made out of bricks so you aint takin out shit and dawg you just did a song with bobby brown so now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard cause

to no motherfuckin bully i wont allow it aint gon cower to no bully ill be damned if i dont stand up to a bully fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully you must be takin too much e   now

something smart but as we grow as men we learn to let shit go but then again theres only so much bullshit we can really stand we all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes its no exception it goes for every man but if irv really gave a fuck about ja like he claims he does hed wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs but he just keeps feedin him pills so if that e doesnt kill him someone from gunit will and i aint buzzed dawg im talkin to you straight if the situation escalates any worse were gonna lose another soldier to this game and if i get killed for this rap i got a million in cash that says i will get you back in hailies name  you aint no motherfuckin bully and i aint bowin to no motherfuckin bully i wont allow it aint gon cower to no bully ill be damned if i

obtruded why should i be secluded ive got a brand new horn to be tooted to sum it up in a nutshell eminem will you kick it for me so i find myself in a certain obligatory a place that i dwell in fell into some wonderful productions to make up for lost time and then it brings obstruction finally let loose unloading the stockpile a mental projectile i aim at the reptile i look to the one handed juggler and ask him this why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus is there a reason for this the hindrance is aggravating how many times will it take you before you realize youre fading fading from existence cause simulations are dead theres so much more to learn and pages left to be read so put up the front while you jam for the grammar thats poor while i hold the scrapbook thats heavier than the hammer of the mighty thor words can weigh a ton therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one   yeah its another  very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side but i see no borderline from under this colorblind and some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred but then im finally about to put an end to the hatred wrong the world would never endure to arguing awaking to the absence of unity is startling oh foolish pride what the hell are you trying to do you cannot beat someone thats better than you so quit trying to your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable so how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable youre graceless bland youre tasteless and youre faceless faceless damn youre dull its time you faced this here taste this straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles the date of my birth on the earth the deliverance of a starchild blessed with formidable talent and versatility but with such a power there comes a responsibilty to infringe on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear to form an alliance is something even the giants fear so instead of being oblivious to the color of skin refusal of usin is accepted now its a trend    yeah its another   you know i dont understand why we all just cant get along you hate me but you know me and what i stand for no so then why do you speak for me and every other white man when you that were your enemy  on the floor lies a broken door cause im not to be spoken for stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore rarely do you see the lighter side of me i try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry but  is isolated apologies are exhausted feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted who can i trust after repeatedly being shafted switch to the opposite now scenes are being reenacted pull up that boy by his roots destroy him quick his fractures obviating we hate him his patterns past us huh always fighting for the position of top dog that spots already occupied and i dont play leapfrog cause i do not wish to fight over territory thats already mine but im always having to prove myself time after time oh how i never understand how a man could be outcast judged from the past and hes put last and others with nothing to say stutterin and slurrin and mutterin words with no meaning attack be signin

not your guardian just the man whos on the mic so let me entertain you   my lyrical content is constantly under fire no wonder why i constantly bomb back to combat attacks with constant concepts when lyrics are constantly took outta context failure to communicate with congress has been a problem for the longest i guess but maybe one day we can make some progress food for thought see how long it takes to digest feelin good when i should be ashamed shit i really shoulda fell but i stood see i came like a flame in the night like a ghost in the dark theres a ray theres a light theres a hope theres a spark but when planets collide theyll never see eye to eye until they decide to set their differences aside and this is why only one of us will survive so children follow my lead and feel the vibe because  im only entertainin you my goal is to stimulate makin you high and take you and i to a place that you cant see but i believe you can fly i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin im not your dad not your mom not your guardian just the man whos on the mic so let me entertain you   my music can be slightly amusin you shouldnt take lyrics so serious it might be confusin tryin to separate the truth from entertainment its stupid aint it i get sick of tryin to explain it see i could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond just being a snot pointynosed bleachblond cause i came here to uplift let your woes be gone tell em to get fucked and just mosey on constantly movin constantly usin the constitution as a form of restitution bless the children nothin less than brilliant

common denominate add it up and youll see just why i dominate i try to stimulate but kids emulate and mimic every move you make slim you great but wait cant you see im only here to entertain i gotta be the one to go against the grain cause man i see it feel it live it but its inhumane for me to see you be influenced and pretend you aint but they dont understand that ive been through pain if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain but you cant just stand there and try to judge it hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much and its such a pleasure every button that i touch i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but  im only entertainin you my goal is to stimulate makin you high and take you and i to a place you that cant see but i believe you can fly i

always sense this undeniable tension from the moment that i enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers whenever theres conversation why am i always mentioned ive been dying to ask its been itching at me is it just because  youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do so instead of just admitting it you walk around and say all kinds of really mean things about me cause

now im back sittin on square one tryin to pick myself up where i started from   i never woulda thought that id see you out of control even though my penis was deep down in your hole you should know between us we was like mates of soul nothin could intervene us especially no hoes you was more so the chalant type i chose til more shows haunted you nights i suppose thats how it go with time spent emotion grows in the beginning friends we decided to roll so whos responsible when you get excited explode and obies grinnin then you invite that obies cold but bitches they gon talk niggas they gon hate we established this way before we became mates so whats required is that you chill with all that fire get your desire when i retire and  spend some time with me say that youll be mine haha i never thought id find someone to be mine lord knows i was right cause you just crossed the line spend some time with me say that youll be mine   i used to say i never met a girl like you before still aint got a fuckin clue as to who you truly are almost went as far as introducin you to my daughters til you went as far as goin and snoopin through my drawers now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for cant believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls if you recall i used to treat you like a groupie broad when we fucked i refused to even take my jewelry off but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off it was a shock it struck me as odd but it turned me on you started gettin moody on me pretty soon wed argue and the ruder you got the more beautiful you got to me and whoda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me its true that i got shot in the heart but when someone seems too good to be true they usually are but see when youre in it its too hard to see til you pull up and see some other dudes car parked and reach up under the seat as your heart starts to beat before you make a decision thats lifealtering and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave you hear them words echoing almost haunting that taunting ring  spend some time with me say that youll be mine haha i never thought id find someone to be mine lord knows i was right cause you just crossed the line spend some time with me say that youll be mine haha   ha ha yeah right bitch spend some time on my dick   in most cases stats attitude is fuck a bitch my only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch but you was different thought we shared a covenant even held your hand in pubalic we sufferin because of this shawty on some whole nother other shit tryin to play slick thinkin ima trick off grip ill admit i was caught in the mix down to commit feedin you the best of me i shouldve fed you piss we started off closer than close but who couldve predicted to know your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth and the final result back in that same boat i asked myself do i love these hoes  nope  yeah em introduced us 50 this is tanya tanya this is 50 then slid off and left her to kick it

the real career move said shes an aspiring actress she do videos for practice yeah yeah know how many times i done heard that shit haha   spend some time with me say that youll be mine i never thought id find someone to be mine lord knows i was right cause you just crossed the line spend some time with me say that youll be mine  still love me take this you ready one two three   the more you put me through the more it makes me wanna come back to you you say you hate me i just love you more you dont want me i just want you more i buy you flowers you throw em at me i know its sad but its makin me happy the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on cause you love me and i love you more   its sick but who could ever predict wed be doin the same shit we say we do it for our baby but we dont we do it for us its lust cause neither one of us trust each other so we fuck till we bust and we cuss each other out we know what its about shout till i throw you out the house you throw me out the house i throw you on the couch punch you in the mouth fist fight til we turn this mother out then apologize after laughter pain its insane were back in the same chapter again and its sad but its true when im layin here with you there aint nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cause  the more you put me through the more it makes me wanna come back to you you say you hate me i just love you

you you fuck other people and i fuck other people youre a slut but im equal im a mutt were both evil in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it cause one of us would have one up on the other so forget it we can make accusations people spread rumors but they aint got proof till they do its just the two of us its you and me cause any chick can say that shes screwin me but you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed if you didnt i wouldnt be hittin  yeah i would cause the sex is too damn good if i ran who would i run to that would be this soft and warm so its off and on usually more off than on but at least we know that we share this common bond youre the only one i can fuck without a condom on i hope the only reason that i cope is cause of that fact and plus i can bust in that and thats why  the more you put me through the more it makes me wanna come back to you you say you hate me i just love you more you dont want me i just want you more i buy you flowers you throw em at me i know its sad but its makin me happy the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on cause you love me and i love you more   i can never understand it thats why i dont try from junior high until we both die its silly oh why must we try is it really so rough that we must always call each others billy goats gruff try to pull each others legs until the other begs were lyin to ourselves thats the beauty of it yeah cause we truly love each other thats why we always fightin all we do is shove each other every other fuckin night and its clear it aint gonna change its pentup rage we both have we both feel like weve been upstaged by someone else weve both been someone elses someone else problem is neither one wants help its an addiction and it cant be fixed our familys mixed up theres a baby sister in the mix and it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle dont fit and anybody who thinks they know us doesnt know shit and theyre probably just tired of hearin it all the time on every song every lyric in every rhyme all the hoopla all of the whooptywoo what you put me through fuckin whooptydo but i wont be made a fool of if this is true love you wouldnt do what you

and suspended in animation like someones holding me there i feel somebodys cold hands wrapping around my neck while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes tripping over odd bodies of dead lushes bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes doors open and close by themselves books fly off shelves curtains catch fire the house melts my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters caught a piece of shrapnel in the adams apple two cups of holy water and im looking at em half full but as soon as i go to touch em they turn into red rum it got silent then all these voices said come follow me into

to record as much before i do the plan is to have as many in the can as i can as i stand before you in this booth a walkingdead man blank stare dead pan look on my face as i gaze into space as i wait to be scooped up in that van as i mysteriously disappear into thin air and they gonna say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere and ill go down in the history as the bloodsuckin leech who hid behind the freedom of speech tried to take the 5th amendment use it twist it and bend it and ended up dyin the villain not the hero splendid stupendous way to end this i can feel the tremors tremendous in remembrance of september 11th flashback to september 7th when 2pac was murdered in vegas he said it he predicted his own death let us never forget it should we ever live to regret it like the day john f kennedy was assassinated in broad day by the crazed lunatic with a gun who just happened to work on the same block in the library book depository where the president would go for a little friday stroll shots fired from the grassy knoll but they dont know or do they whos they for them to say touch were all vulnerable and its spookay this is about as kookay as ive ever felt now count down to nuclear meltdown seven six five four three two one you can run you can do what you want to but you know you aint gonna do nothin when its time its your time you are the prime target you have become public enemy number one  yo man yo marsh man yo youve been kickin all this shit about yourself what of the homies man oh you want one about the posse alright   ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride   well foolish pride has a lot of things to say you got foolish pride like you got tooth decay but tooth decay is another problem so lets take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it now when i talk about foolish pride i mean blacks and whites taking different sides when blacks and whites take different sides unity never happens and we will subside we will subside and hatred will release and everything will just crush that peace but when we crush that peace you see we start hatin each other but remember you are my brother and you are my sister just like im a mister i seen a black girlfriend and i kissed her i kissed her i placed it on her cheek and she didnt come back til next week now it was next week and she was back again wanting to kiss a white kid so she was my girlfriend we started going out but thats okay because we were black and white blacks and whites sometimes mix but black girls only want your money cause theyre dumb chicks so ima say like this dont date a black girl take it as a diss if you want but if you dont ima tell you like this i surely wont never date a black girl because blacks only want your money and that shit aint funny so ima say look honey why do you do this you know you step up to me like you a brutus then you try to grab my spinach because its green and thats cash so get outta here cause i dont need your ass i said that before but thats okay because like i said youre a whore black girls and white girls just dont mix because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks white girls are good i like white girls i like white girls all over the world white girls are fine and they blow my mind and thats why im here now telling you this rhyme cause black girls i really dont like we dont mix its like riding a bike when youre peddling hard uphill both ways you know its kinda hard and thats why i say to you im giving you a little advice dont date a black girl if you do it once you wont do it twice you wont ever do it again because theyll take your money and that aint funny so ima say look honey ive already said that before but like i said again youre nothing but a big whore so when mike catch on the bass line thats okay cause we will not just waste time ill get straight to the point black girls are bitches thats why ima tell you you better pull up your britches cause all that cash is making your ass drag from the boyfriend you ganked and thats pretty bad i mean thats pretty sad when youre dating a black guy and then you turn around and fuck another big black guy now thats pretty wrong but youre just ganking but thats okay because you need a god damn spanking from me the funky mm im busting rhymes and im swallowing phlegm im busting a freestyle just like this i say swallowing phlegm and howard gets pissed but when howard gets pissed thats okay because he leaves and he doesnt show up for two more days so ill just worry about that problem when i come to it ill cross that bridge when i come to it cause i forgot the chorus but thats okay cause yall saying bust a rhyme for us so ima bust another rhyme about this black girl she turned out to be a fuckin wack girl a wack girl because black girls aint funny all they want is your goddamn money they take you for everything youve got and then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand so ima kick it to you just like this how does the chorus go i forgot but thats okay cause ima tell you in stride ima say ole foolish pride  ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh date a white girl cause they got the raw hide  your mother you fuckin faggot ayo this next song is dedicated to the memory of erik shrody rest in peace we aint forget about you you fuckin homo we still remember   there once was a man who liked to jump around but he got too old to jump up and down so he put the mic down and picked the guitar up started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow left his boys in the house of pain it was the wisest decision he ever made but the dumbest thing he could ever do was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady tell me now what you gonna do   cause i remember all those years how it was when you were here i remember how it was how it was when you were young yesterday was so long ago kid rock and limp bizkit came along now dont nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more  i remember back when you had the knack and i remember when you had your first heart attack i was right there laughin when i heard the news i just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you maybe icets right you are a bitch you come around when youre broke and you

like you to meet my friend bob huh say hi bob hi bob bobs thirty and still lives with his mom and he dont got a job cause bob sits at home and smokes pot but his twelveyearold brother looks up to him an awful lot and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock when its late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog drag em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks ahh and even if they escaped and they got the cops the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge til one night mrs stacey went off the job when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off but bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker crazier than slim shady is off the vodka you couldnt even take him to dres to get bob a doctor he grabbed stace by the legs as he chopped it off her and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her but ever since the day stacey went off to wander they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner and thats the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you so see if the squirrels want itits bad for you  see children drugs are bad come on and if you dont believe me ask your dad ask him man and if you dont believe him ask your mom thats right shell tell you how she does em all

you will see that i am not the only one whos off his rocker there were many before me i was always labeled the black sheep of the family what a bad seed id grow to be but if you take a look at us now youll see the apple didnt fall too far from the tree   haha haha haha haha alright look ima tell you the story from my side maybe youll understand check it out   you done witnessed unexplainable shit too insane to explain people run from what they just dont get maybe shady should have just hit em with a little bit did i spit too soon should i have spoon fed em it but i was just so eager to prove i was even worth bein in the same league or the room of the people of whom i was in every now and then i look up like i was seekin approval was it because of the pigment of my skin or was it a figment of my imagination maybe it bothered me more than it did them maybe it wasnt a big deal back then but to me it was see what it was was i had developed a complex from being judged proof spit his verse now im next lets see who balks im in the booth staring back to see whose mugs i get a reaction from usually the first thumb was from proof and the rest of the crew backed him up and no one lied to each other cause none of us had deals it was real we just wanted tickets for that meal  sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im goin crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree i said sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im goin crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree   ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg cause she said that i had a baby sister who fell out of the window i was too young to remember kansas city projects i was like fivesix and how come i remember malcolm isaac and boogy if it was the projects in missouri cause those were my best friends until isaac took my tricycle and my uncle todd went to try to go get it back and ended up gettin jumped and cut in the gut with a switch and seventysome stitches which is to this day why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture of a fictitious little sister who never existed and this is why a part of my lifes so twisted but i can never be as sick as that bitch is and by the way that pictures one of my relatives  sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im goin crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree i said sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im goin crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree   you probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain to see why everything i say is so insane whats different about my brain that separates me from other players in this game on the surface it may seem like a scheme or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy but thats the last thing i need is for people to walk around feelin sorry for me and i am not a g never claimed to be i gave my vest to cahis just hope he dont need it more than me but well see cause we aint lookin for beef but if it comes our way what do we turn the other cheek come on   sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im goin crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree i said sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im goin crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree  yeah and im the crazy one right whatever then let me be the crazy one

motherfuckin neighbors but see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when i leave but why does it seem like im not even put up in the same category as other mcs so when weezy says that hes better than jay z please be that just subliminally means he thinks jiggas the best and that hes the only one up in that league see and its easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is knowin goddamn well that im one of the best motherfuckin rappers who ever lived period  im a goat and i dont mean to gloat but i know what i know and i know what you think and these magazinesll never put it in ink because how would it look if they considered me as a goat and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and i consider myself one of those so thank you very much here it goes   maybe they figure that im on my way out the game so they gotta go try to find em a new eminem or a new shady if they think its gonna happen man i thought i was crazy or maybe i could be takin it wrong and theyre tryna pay homage to me in a strange way so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way see you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin up paul walls white cause lyrically he doesnt pose a threat to anyone see hes just aight and bubba sparxxx he just wont write because hes so caught up in that snow white that timbaland cant even get him in the studio hes so gone off that coke right and its so sad cause hes dope right americas next great white hope right so now they feel like they gotta come up with some cornyass white rapper show right and which im still havin mixed feelings about they said itd be real im just spillin it out theres somethin about a white boy talkin black and runnin around with a damn grill in his mouth and i love when the say that tiger woods shit isnt it ironic that the best rappers white and the best golfers black and im the one whos gotta catch all the flack off of that but these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until 8 mile had came out but i had already hit middle america parents had all got to likin me now when suddenly i wasnt such a bad guy all of the hatred for me mustve died thought i committed career suicide so i had to turn back into the bad guy so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays anatomy god made raggedy ann and andy not raggedy andy and andy and andy and angelina jolie is just another ho and brad is a sucka because once i fuck her she wants to go to somalia to adopt another baby you know what i say  no you better save some of them kids from madonna she needs all the publicity she can get you wanted shady well you got it man i aint apologizin for shit  im a goat and i dont mean to gloat but i know what i know and i know what you think and these magazinesll never put it in ink because how would it look if they considered me as a goat and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and i consider myself one of those so thank you very much here it goes   man im takin my ball and goin home man shit is too easy nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause im a goat so dont worry im out the motherfuckin game and yall can sit and argue about whos the motherfuckin best but yall know that im a goat and like i said im one of the motherfuckin best before you get your panties in a motherfuckin bunch but before i go id like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasnt there from the start and thank you very much to everybody who was and yall aint gotta say it just think it cause i know

your empathy i dont need your apology or your friendship or sympathy its revenge that i seek so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potentiali peeked continue to peep still bent low then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak all the way round to the back porch man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this you dont plan for intruders beforehand surprised to see me cat got your tongue gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans ironys spectacular huh now whos a faggot you punk and heres your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck its just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it were in a car right nowwait here comes my favorite lyric im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die and hey heres a sequel to my mathers lp just to try to get people to buy hows this for a publicity stunt this should be fun last album now cause after this youll be officially done eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell bitch i even have your initials i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it since youre in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here two more exits time is quite near hope we dont get stopped no license i fear that sirens i hear guess ninety on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea as cops appear in my drivers side mirror oh god police aaaghh hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial

swim good now say you hate homos again part 2 produced by streetrunner   i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in im your karma closin in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope its hopeless im the denial that youre hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again backs to the wall im stackin up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause im talkin a lot of shit but im backin it all up but in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience im the ringing in your ears im the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged grab for some water but im that pill thats too jagged to swallow im the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin back on ya every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rappers persona is half a facade and matthew and stans just symbolic of you not knowin what you had til its gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them im the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow if you dont stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits when its time to walk away im every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if theres anything you have left to say less it makes an impact then dont bother so fore you rest your case better make sure youre packing a wallop so one last time im back fore it fades into black and its all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark uh as we pick up where the last mathers left off  dont kill me   hurry the fuck up  shoots the teller thank you  running go go go what the fuck the fuck did he go mothafucka bail on me fuck you car stops working aw you gotta be fucking kidding me are you fucking kidding me shit  running climbs a fence get off  shoots a dog haha  sirens parking lot shit ah  let me see your hands bend over   ah fuck it shoots himself  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah whats your name marshall whos your daddy i dont have one   my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon and had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in the side of locomotive with rap im loco its like handing a psycho a loaded handgun michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum bout to explode all over the canvas back with the yoda of rap in a spasm your music usually has em but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasnt follow you must rick rubin my little padawan a jedi in training colossal brain and thoughts are entertainin but docile and impossible to explain and im also vain and probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk full of such blind rage i need a seein eye dog cant even find the page i was writing this rhyme on oh its on the rampage couldnt see what i wrote i write small it says ever since i drove a 79 lincoln with whitewalls had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard so as long as im on the clock punching this time card hiphop aint dying on my watch  now sometimes when im sleepin she comes to me in my dreams is she taken is she mine dont got time dont care dont have two shits to give let me take you by the hand to promised land and threaten everyone cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing   now whats your name marshall whos your daddy i dont know him but i wonder is he rich like me ha has he taken any time to show you what you need to live   no if he had he wouldnt have ended up in these rhymes on my pad i wouldnt be so mad my attitude wouldnt be so bad yeah dad im the epitome and the prime example of what happens when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and makes you want to get up and start dancin even if it is charles manson who just happens to be rappin blue lights flashin laughin all the way to the bank lampin in my kmart mansion im in the style department with a pile in my cart rippin the aisle apart but with great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content completely despondent and condescending the king of nonsense and controversy is on a beatkilling spree your honor i must plead guilty cause i sparked a revolution rebel without a cause who caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level boost it but several rebuked it and whoever produced it hiphop is the devils music does that mean it belongs to me cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns that dont honk but every time i speak you hear a beep but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper rappers better stay clear of me bitch cause its the  its the time of the season when hate runs high and this time i wont give it to you easy when i take back whats mine with pleasured hands and torture everyone that is my plan my job here isnt done cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing   whats your name shady whos your daddy i dont give a fuck but i wonder is he rich like me doubt it ha has he taken any time to show you what you need to live   so yeah dadlets walk lets have us a fatherandson talk but i bet we wouldnt probably get one block without me knocking your block off this is all your fault maybe thats why im so bananas i appealed to all those walks of life whoever had strife maybe thats what dad and son talks are like cause i related to the struggles of young america when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles now theyre rippin out their fuckin hair again its hysterical i chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles yeah uhoh better beware knuckle heads the sign of my hustle says dont knock the doors broken it wont lock it might just fly open get coldcocked you critics come to pay me a visit misery loves company please stay a minute kryptonite to a hypocrite zip your lip if you dish it but cant take it too busy gettin stoned in your glass house to kick rocks then you wonder why i lash out mr mathers as advertised on the flyers so spread the word cause im promoting my passion

life offers why bother even tryin to put up a fight its nonsense but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience what about them rhymes ive been jottin they are kind of giving me confidence

contradicts how im livin put a dick in your rear end thats why every time you mentioned a lyric i thanked you for it for drawin more attention toward it cause it gave me an enormous platform im

more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it lifes handin you lemons make lemonade then but if i cant batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then dont mistake him for satan its a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and dont be a retardbe a king think not why be a king when you can be a god  or eminem has a full line of chainsaws eminem eminem eminem eminem eminem eminem marshall mathers eminem the rapper eminem who can say for sure perhaps a frontal lobotomy

too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know   sometimes i feel like all i ever do is find different ways to word the same old song ever since i came along from the day the song called hi my name is dropped started thinking my name was fault cause any time things went wrong i was the one who they would blame it on the media made me the equivalent of a modernday genghis khan tried to argue it was only entertainment dog gangster nah courageous balls had to change my style they said im way too soft and i sound like az and nas out came the claws and the fangs been out since then but up until the instant that i went against it it was ingrained in me that i wouldnt amount to a shit stain i thought no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught do i really belong in this game i pondered i just wanna play my part should i make waves or not so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on and i dont wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form i was raised upon but sometimes you gotta take a loss and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off and keep plugging its your only outlet and your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah feel like ive already said this a kabillion 80 times how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme what i really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are when i was afraid to  i was a afraid to make a single sound afraid i would never find a way out out out afraid id never be found my dreams i didnt wanna go another round yeah an angry mans power will shut you up agh trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love run out of excuses

started to spit harder shit learned how to harness it while the reins were off and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck haters started to appreciate my art and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain i caused but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone and the lights go out in that trailer park oh and the window is closing and theres nowhere else that i can go with flows and im frozen cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song but id rather make not afraid 2 than make another motherfucking we made you ah now i dont wanna seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs my demise and my uprise pray to god i just open enough eyes later on and gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use thatll make you strong enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt cause i cant explain

pick up the phone not at all followin protocol i get bold like bowling balls grow balls and go to call to talk forget what i want to say damnit im drawin blanks like im playin hangman im sick of playin these games i cant handle this heartbreak its makin me wanna blow out my brains like birthday cake candles hang up the phone and i shake i think i may have made a mistake cant escape the madness turn the radio on i hate this sad song but i cant even change the station the same ones playin on eight channels i lay awake in shambles im startin to hallucinate im havin all these visions of us at each others wakes in caskets and suddenly i wake and thats when i know i  saw two white coffins in my dreams last night i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointed toward the light saw my old sweetheart she said honey im back just so you dont die alone just so you dont die alone   give me one more bottle for the pain give me one more for the memories give me one more ill make it taste like a steak itll help alleviate itll soothe this ache of trying to fake that shes really shes really coming back   and its been a while now but i finally realize how much reality sucks but its just something about our love im still in denial now dealing with the finality of and its making me crazy thinking of the days we spent and how ill never hold you again and there aint shit i can do about it now my head is overcrowded with these clouded memories and i cant seem to get you out it and how the fuck do you sleep comfortably knowing what you done did to me huh did it even occur to you that i loved you completely deep and madly head over heels for you was you and me once used to be together forever it was supposed to be us but you crushed the dream we was supposed to die together and its killing me so much when i sleep i wake up dead must be why i  saw two white coffins in my dreams last night i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointed toward the light saw my old sweetheart she said honey im back just so you dont die alone just so you dont die alone  another day another hotel the inside of it is nice though oh well this is my life so as i go and try on clothes for tonights show to see how far that line goes still blows my mind show business guess ill just never get so this shit just always feels so weird to this day because alls i ever did was just say the shit i wouldve wanted to hear other people say to me when i was a kid so please dont make me some type of hero cause i will say some ol inspirational shit in a real way but still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit in the world and tell it to suck on the dick cause i still make fun of a sitch someones in like a son of a bitch at anothers expense im fuckin relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen i struggle with coming to senses stuck on the fence its a balance beam if i seem unbalanced its challenging when my conscience allows me to think the most foulest childish things without even blinking without even thinkin about all the stinkin amounts of people that seems to be reachin but the crowds theyre screaming and the palace sold out this evening but now its lay me down to sleep and is it really my soul to keep or have i sold it cheap is it greed and do i take more than i need when i joke of leavin but keep overachievin cause what its stole from me ive barely broken even  i know its a fine fine line living in hope or dire need i know its a fine fine line living in hope or dire need   so a martyr is how i paint myself and through my harrowin ordeals im so vain i want my respect but ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect til i sit in the dark and i reflect and my reflection shows what its like here cause this vanity surrounded by all these lights yeah its like a nightmare i said this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror and i dont like how i see myself so i open the bible to isaiah cause i swear to christ there are nights when i stay up and might say a prayer twice just to make sure god hears cause this ice layer i skate ons a nice way of putting it but i like stayin feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player i got a nice paradise here sealed off in my lair away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from and this house is quite bare but it aint when you cant leave it and i feel so isolated its nice i made it but its like i paid the price of fame twice i hate it so i bitch about my life then make another song vicious cycle aint it then wonder why i stay famous i keep walkin the line this goldfish bowl gets old but especially when you dont know if your conscience is sayin i told you so cause you dont even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier or you sold your soul  i know its a fine fine line living in hope or dire need i know its a fine fine line living in hope or dire need   and from here you look so small hovering high above us all please come back to me   i still remember the times when they were simpler than the rhymes of vanilla ice were when i was just killin the mics ill never forget what that feeling was like i miss those times now when i was just starting out without a dime and now im diamond i cant even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when ive been stuck in this house hibernatin hate even going outside it sucks sometimes i just wanna walk into target and look at shit and browse i dont even want to buy nothin i just wanna fuckin walk around inside it look how excited i sound when i get to talkin bout life and everything about it i miss which now reminds me put a thousand lighters in the sky for the outsidaz wow i must have had alzheimers long time since i shouted them out bout time cause its been on my mind lately how zee you always supported me you vouched i will never forget that and how you guys accepted me for me and pace i love you too you slept on my couch and ive been thinkin bout the time when i slept on the floor at the outhouse rhymings all we ever wanted to do and regardless how life has turned out inside ill ill always be an outsider my life has been turned inside out but i  i know its a fine fine line living in hope or dire need i know its a fine fine line living in hope or dire need   but i keep walkin the line  i feel phenomenal as usual pharmaceuticals glue sniffin pools of vomit at bonnaroo but i dont know if im in tennessee chicago or houston in the corner tryin to seek solitude shallow but such a hollow dude i wont even swallow solid food alcoholic too plus im on lean like the tower of pisa top it off im on mushrooms so fuck all of you roses are violet mollies are blue lost in a ball of confusion its all an illusion its probably the shrooms im on cause i think i started hallucinating cause i just thought i heard jay electronica and odd futures new shit and all i could do was follow the music and end up with paula abdul at lollapalooza fillin water balloons with nailpolish remover just to pop em and wallow in fumes i feel uptight i gotta get looser after i finish polishing off this bottle of booze i got a solution concentrated like orange juice so im not as deluded cause all this delusion got me seein shit excusezmoi but that hoochie that passed you see her ass wouldnt make her my main squeeze butt juicier ass it belongs in a juicer its mouthwaterin too so i walked over to her like im marshall wanna try to meet my standards ill introduce ya oh im a misogynist too but im not a masseuse but my attitude is rubbin off on the youth uh chronic abuser and i dont mean a user of marijuana i mean verbal assault that i use to smoke all of you losers got a bazooka a shotgun a ruger a glock and a nuke and a rottweiler too and im not in the mood so when i say im bringing the tec out im not coming to repair your fuckin electronic computers god im gonna puke im so gone off the hookah i think i swallowed a loofah im tore up demolished im fuckin stoned like oliver like i looked medusa in the eyeball to seduce her the thoughts i produce are loony tunes the box of reusable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes that were placed next to veronicas boobs and the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box in a blue honda with used condoms were clues the girl was just not the one suitable for him  right for me that will change me rearrange my head to be just right for you and me dont laugh please listen to me   thought id give in to the pressure collapse and crumble perhaps relapsing under that well thats a bunch of crap in the clutch im the captain crunch of rap and im sick of acting humble thats enough of that fuck that shit cut the sack like its a natural reaction thats why im actually trapped in this shoving match cause push keeps coming to that i can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit still mad disgruntled had some struggles yeah but that passion and hungers back what a fantastic juggling act and the way i flip my tongue on the track its like verbal acrobatics but in fact last time i tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic i fuckin crashed my hovercraft after i strapped a duffel bag to my back and stuffed a massive punchin bag in it and an elastic bungee strap rubber plaster a thumb tack and a piece of plastic bubble wrap went spastic and fuckin snapped jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid stumbled back recovered back flipped and landed on a gymnastic tumble mat and for my last trick lunge on back latch on a nasa shuttle flap fuckin snap the rudder in half chuckled and laughed utter my last rebuttal and just as im to come crashin i grab my gogogadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat rub my magic mushroom tat for luck then splat get up from that face taped to a waste paper basket throw up then gasp lungs collapsed and thats more likely than finding someone thats  right for me that will change me rearrange my head to be just right for you and me dont laugh please listen to me   couple of shots of jger public intoxication disfuckincombobulation flooded with thoughts of anger while i was away i know probably some of you got to thinkin youre top ten aint cha stop it you fuckers are talkin crazy and stop interrupting youre not even up in that conversation whether youre punchin a clock or famous underground pop or nameless whatever your job is i give a fuck whats your occupation youre thinkin just cause you came in with scrubs and you brought the scalpel and sponge the oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon stuck in the operating room once you done swapped your name with him smuggled in ronald reagan if you dug him up donald fagen while juggling waffles bacon a fuckin mcdonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagled it flung it across the table then bump it and knock it shake it jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration i said fuck it and lost my patience they all woke up from sedation aint none of you dr dre so then what is it got you thinkin you can fuck with this operation aftermath still running hiphop amazin im still pluggin along no need for an assumption heres confirmation im up for the long duration im just looking for something to walk away with some pocket change and a little integrity though ill probably be jumpin across the stage til im fuckin madonnas age and stuck in an awkward place in my life but i shit you not like im plugged up with constipation that day will come before i finally stumble upon some lady thats  right for me that will change me rearrange my head to be just right for you and me dont laugh please listen to me  yo if you could just for one minute or one split second in time forget everything everything that bothers you all your problems everything

even when im gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die   i can hear the drummer drummin and the trumpets someones tryna summon someone i know somethings comin but im runnin from it to be standing at the summit and plummet how come it wasnt what i thought it was was it too good to be true have nothin get it all but too much of it then lose it again did i swallow hallucinogens cause if not where the hell did it go cause here i sit in lucifers den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin even if it means im sellin my soul just to be the undisputed again do whatever i gotta do just to win cause i got this motherfuckin cloud over my head crown around it thorns on it cracks in it bet you morons didnt think id be back did ya how bout that im somehow now

the river run    hands up officer dont shoot then pull your pants up promise you wont loot we may never understand each other its no use we aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through   black boy black boy we aint gonna lie to you black boy black boy we dont like the sight of you pull up on the side of you window rolled down profile then we wonder why we see this side of you probably comin from the dope house we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out we know youre hidin that heidi klum on you another drug charge homie its back inside for you and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true pistol drew right at you wed be delighted to unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you fucked up but what the fuck am i to do i keep tellin myself keep doin like youre doin no matter how many lives you ruin its for the red white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no ones ever indicted you why cause youre a  white boy white boy youre a rockstar my momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy youre untouchable the worlds coming to an end i dont even care nobody can tell me shit cause im a big rockstar   black boy black boy we dont get your culture and we dont care what our governments done to fuck you over man dont tell us your attitudes a result of that balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at why you kicking that soda can pull your pants up we bout to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you dont have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy were fightin a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities thats what we call em pigsties for theyre like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like were stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins its like were drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky cause this keeps happening throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit and i admit there have been times where its been embarrassin to be a  white boy white boy youre a rockstar my momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy youre untouchable the worlds coming to an end i dont even care nobody can tell me shit cause im a big rockstar     seems like the average lifespan of a white man is more than twice than a black life span i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner i feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance id rather hear em say die nword than die antwoord ninja now its better disguised banter but thats life strapped cause were strapped financially and cant find answers were applying but mcdonalds seems to be the only franchise thatll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder thats why its at a stalemate and cant arrive at a compromise so its black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin white cops in the black neighborhoods who aint acclimated to em like thats the way to do it who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and thats racism the fear that a black face gives em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us sectioneightd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every days another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes its like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my its more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers cause no one oversees these cops and all we see is em beat charges we done seen em beat rodney king unconscious and got off so we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings just keep marchin til we reach congress but theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kaepernick tantrum if you dont stand for the national anthem we raise it you better praise it or youll be made to feel like a traitor well treat you like rodney dangerfield home of the brave is still racist ville so this whole nation feels like a plantation field in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals that had its natives killed got you singin this starspangled spiel to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build  yeah damn girl do i drive you crazy

all he does is watch fox news like a parrot and repeats while he looks like a canary with a beak why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet hes tryin to divide us this shits like a cult but like johnny hell only unite us cause nothin inside us drives us like this fight does similar to when two cars collide cause our spirits crushed and this spots a tight one but here the jaws of life come to pull us from the wreckage thats what we get pride from when we cant from our stars and stripes cause this type of pickle that were in is hard to deal but theres always tomorrow

you aint ruinin our country punk or takin our pride from us you wont define us cause like a dictionary things are lookin up so much got a sprained neck know we would rise up against this train wreck and take a stand even if it means sittin when they raise the flag to sing the starspangled banner this man just praised a statue of general lee cause he generally hates the black people degrades hispanics take it back to the shady national convention wish i woulda spit on it before i went to shake his hand at the event or maybe had the wherewithal to know that he was gonna try to tear apart our sacred land we cherish and stand for so hands in the air lets hear it for the start of a brand new america without him and be proud of where were from and heres to where we all  and heres to where

me theres no place like home  we never saw from each others sides or eye to eye just eye for eye lie for lie fight or flight so much baggage need a luggage rack but we carry on with our public spats and our feuds up back in the news love taps when i dissed you like it was fun actually used to run back to the booth jump back in the studio give you a tonguelashing then you laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone it was funny back in our youth but then it wasnt after we knew that we were done and actually through and actually through but if theres one fraction of truth if it could be spun back i would do so many things different things different cause it was such a dumbass excuse you hit me once and that i would use to continue the pattern of abuse why did i punch back girls your dad is a scumbag im confused because  how come you can be a lord and a loser how come how come you can be a liar and a good father a good dad but a bad husband why are you a good father a great dad but a bad husband   you were the beat i loved with a writers block the line thats hot that i forgot we laughed a little cried a lot ill never forget when you came home and you held hailie day before you went to jail and daily how wed wait for that mail lady or by the phone for mom to call and i watched you pull yourself up and we decided on givin it one more try despite it all youre my lightning rod when my sky gets dark im your shiny rocks in that tiny box when we tied the knot when we broke the knot every line we crossed we were supposed to not every time we fought the insults they got thrown too far words that we said that we didnt mean the words that we meant that we didnt say the ones that we thought that we shoulda said letters written that we coulda read which maybe woulda led to some good instead and had this put to bed but id be lyin still if i said i wasnt sittin here askin myself  how come you can be a lord and a loser how come how come you can be a liar and a good father a good dad but a bad husband why are you a good father a great dad but a bad husband dad you said forever be a hero in my eyes i reply but theres always another side to a good father a great dad but a bad husband   we brought out the worst in each other someone had to make the sparring end cause i loved you but i hated that me and i dont wanna see that side again but im sorry kim more than you could ever comprehend leavin you was fuckin harder than sawing off a fuckin body limb once upon a time were all we had maybe thats what drew us to each other it was true love shit we never knew was possible we might have loved each other too much and maybe thats what made us do what we did to each other all the screwups cause you always thought that you was more in love with me and i was thinkin i was more in love than you was for all the times that we thought it worked til we saw how wrong we were when the dust settles now and all the dirt if i touch the rawest nerve all i want is for us not to hurt and its been an exhaustive search to find the words but i just heard mockingbird and got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts the purpose was not to stir up or open wounds ive caused a few and so have you or argue whose fault it was partly yours partly mine but really no ones this is so tough im gettin choked up oh fuck it we both suck we broke up got back together we both thought we had forever not bad people just bad together we were so nuts backstabbed each other another blow struck but theres no duckin this blow cause its over and its closure but im not so sure how to close this i just dont know how some people can be so good at one thing and so fucked at a whole nother shit its no wonder  how come how come you can be a lord and a loser how come how come you can be a liar and a good father a good dad but a bad husband why are you a good father a great dad but a bad husband dad you said forever be a hero in my eyes i reply but theres always another side to a good father a great dad but a bad husband  im stumbling i cant see straight and its my fault i got this way i got my hands on something great and found a way to mess it up i did my best i tried to change but its just in my dna i got my hands on something great and found a way to fuck it up again   now im the one thing you couldnt hate more but youre the one thing that i would die for   all my life i was told i was never nothing special i dont need to be reminded of it every other second specially when all my selfesteems already shot to hell im falling helplessly im embarrassed i dont want no one else to see cause i feel like im a piece of shit every time she yells at me selfishly addicted definitely doesnt help that she makes me feel like ive died and gone to heaven but makes life a living hell for me she does that thing with her lip now shes melting me im putty in her palms im wrapped around her finger a yoyo on a string she lets me sit there and just dangle until something better comes along and shell just drop me like a hot potato i look like im in pain but im okay though cause i know she loves memy friends what do they know  its like im drowning at sea hoping that you reach for me i know youre there but i cant see cause im so drunk off tragic endings im dying to breathe and all you do is strangle me such a beautiful relief cause im so drunk off tragic endings drunk off tragic endings   in my moments of weakness i openly admit the shit i wouldnt normally im extremely selfconscious and enormously insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me it only turns to ammunition for her in this war when she gets goin she dont stop when im up shes like a downer when i found her it was love at first encounter but somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for me to walk on when im around her but theres just something about her that makes me not able to function without her how can i get out of it when i dont know how to im a doubter im a pessimist make a believer out of me and show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain cause im going straight down the drain im drowning  its like im drowning at sea hoping that you reach for me i know youre there but i cant see cause im so drunk off tragic endings im dying to breathe and all you do is strangle me such a beautiful relief cause im so drunk off tragic endings drunk off tragic endings   now im the one thing you couldnt hate more but youre the one thing that i would die for   it took a while for me to get it but i think ive figured it out she dont want me she just dont wanna see me with someone else the idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself to see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health but it annoys her to see me get the strength to say screw her i threw up on myself im dumb sick im addicted to her shes tryna block the door so heres how i do her since im manure shes a sewer and this time this piece of shits running through her i can see the light now im running to it what the fuck shoulda knew it who would think shed actually have the balls to do it as soon as i hopped in it she doused the car with lighter fluid shes standing there with a rag bout to put the lighter to it lit the fucking thing on fire then she threw it  its like im drowning at sea hoping that you reach for me i know youre there but i cant see cause im so drunk off tragic endings im dying to breathe and all you do is strangle me such a beautiful relief cause im so drunk off tragic endings drunk off tragic endings  feeling kinky lip syncing to too horts freaky tales biatch having creepy visions of whiskey drinking and envisioning sneaking into where christie brinkley dwells i know this is risky thinking but i wanna stick her like shes decals but when murdering females better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail if you get scratched because your dnall be all up under her fingernails man he hears you i dont think he cares he gives a fuck even his pinky swears three personalities burstin out of me please beware her tv blares cant hear the creaking stairs shes unaware in no underwear shes completely bare turns around and screams i remember distinctly i said im here to do sink repairs chop her up

pence back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip these are things that id rather do than hear you on a mic since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and jesus christ man how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch fuck my side chick you wont ever see em icy but as cold as i get on the mic i polarize shit so the thames might freeze and your skull might split like i bashed

in mumbojumbo the era that im from will pummel you thats what its comin to what the fuck youre gonna do when you run into it im gonna crumble you and ill take a number two and dump on you if you aint joyner if you aint kendrick or cole or sean then youre a goner im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonalds but if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get revival but yall are actin like i tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned and you woulda bought it but sayin i no longer got it cause you missed a line and never caught it cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist and im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what ill never be is flawless all ill ever be is honest illa illa illa even when im gone theyre gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldnt bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that ima hit my bottom if i dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i dont see why yall even started with me i get in beefs my enemies die i dont cease fire til at least all

one a day im not done preach  cause i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it cause the way i see people turnings makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined cause im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back id at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that hes deserted but i think its workin these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous and hes too scurred to answer me with words cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least hes heard it cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him or ask if im linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis cause theyve been pannin my album to death so ive been givin the media fingers dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but theyve been puttin me through the ringer so i aint ironin shit out with the press but i just took this beat to the cleaners  motherfuckers talkin crazy yeah

saturday batman matinee must have missed my cat scan that day yeah i just threw a tampax at dre trashcan tascam and ashtray im turnin back to a madman cant take anymore but i try to get away from the

day when you say that somethin you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat or you had them choked up youd be yankin my chain ayy feel like im headed for the padded cell the bar for me when i rap

included a multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse we were so bulletproofwrote souped and soaked in our youth thought we was runnin shit til we lost the sole of our shoe the death of doody broke us in two we were thrown for a loop aint none of us know what to do and at the time i was goin through my own struggles too so i wasnt in no condition to be coachin us through everyone tried to go solo really nobody blew i was hopin they do so i aint have to shoulder the crew the plan was put everyone in position so that they knew how to stand on their own and i dont wanna open up wounds i just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth cause the truth is the moment that proof died so did the group shoot  if i could leave this all behind i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line down to the river with you help me leave this all behind   ima wash away my sins ima rinse away this dirt i forgot to make amends to all the friends i may have hurt i better stop and say my grace from it i pray that i dont fall cause on the way back down i may end up runnin back into them all i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones   it was never the same and its bothered me since and the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets the more time goes by the more life happens and we gotta be men we got responsibilities plus we dont say how we feel and i feel like this is what got us in the debacle were in been with you guys thick and thin but its almost as if sometimes were not even friends which reminded me biz rockstar was the shit yall coulda got you a hit without me on the shit if youda put d12 on it wish i coulda did porter tried talkin you into comin up off it i know it wasnt my fault but part of it probably is i think of all of the trips to bet and the rappers i wish that we woulda politicked with maybe yall coulda clicked and got you some features but thats water under the bridge but im washin my sins in it til my conscience is cleansed  if i could leave this all behind i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line down to the river with you help me leave this all behind   ima wash away my sins ima rinse away this dirt i forgot to make amends to all the friends i may have hurt i better stop and say my grace from it i pray that i dont fall cause on the way back down i may end up runnin back into them all i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones   bacardi and hen never thought the party would end one minute youre bodyin shit but then your audience splits you can already sense the climate is startin

the artists you dissed all the carnage you left is this the kind of karma you get for turnin your fuckin back on bizzy kuniva and swift a freudian slip subconsciously i honestly wished i aint feel so much guilt and yall didnt harbor resentment but its hard to pretend that yall aint got none i just wish i had words but i guess there just are none for this to my partners i cant say how sorry i am this is not how i planned for our story to end i love all of you men but i just cant be the guy everybody depends on for entire careers cause thats not even fair i will always be here but that spark isnt there and i dont know how to recapture that time and that era ive tried hearkening back to but im fightin for air im barely chartin myself feels like im on the descent but it was not my intent to treat yall like a stepping stone though i aint left no one behind but we been down every road done all we possibly can i know we kept our hopes up but the longer we spend livin this lie that we live the less is left for closure so lets let this go its not goodbye to our friendship but d12 is over  ima wash away my sins ima rinse away this dirt i forgot to make amends to all the friends i may have hurt i better stop and say my grace from it i pray that i dont fall cause on the way back down i may end up runnin back into them all i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones   i never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones i never meant to use you all for my stepping stones  illa illa illa yeahyeah yeahyeah yo yo how do i keep man i dont know whats up with these hoes man gettin

thousand states cause i enjoyed it insykeable make a commitment and taking that step with a fitbit and digged it only you can think about me my figment  ive always looked at battle rap as competition or war and the main objective is to destroy completely fuckin obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything whatever the fuck you can to get a reaction from the crowd so nothings off limits i need you to spit that lyrical miracle in the swimming pool   before this kicks off let me set my balls on this tees cause im dottin is every time i cross one of these theres not a redeeming quality at all in me its impossible seems like an implausible dream positive clean thoughts intervene but theyre all either altered and mean assault and demean tossed and theyre being lost in the scheme squashed in between a brainwashing machine like an islamic regime a jihadist extreme radical suicide bomber thats seeing ariana grande sing her last song of the evening and as the audience from the damn concert is leaving detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region im not gonna finish that for obvious reasons but bring your dogs ima muzzle em im not middle eastern but ill make a bitch rock a hijab and at least a extra large in a tshirt headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet hasta la vista i go hamas on the beats a paradox on the beach and a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list gettin head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich professional shit sprayer bitch watch who you talkin to like apple wristwear endangered species in this abc shit a bit scarce preys decreasing i face extinction like disc players told this chick shes hot as jada pinkett and just stared til i made her think it said maybe we should just get married shes facing me

febreze in the chicks hair make her wheeze tryna get air i played for keeps theres no escaping me i have a bitch scared and chained to me and throw away the key and shell be so afraid to leave that even if she ends up breaking free shell just sit there tryin to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up its impossible like rapin a slut we stay buttnaked and fuck youre close wait for you what my idea you comin too is waking you up with smelling salts after i quaalude your cup thatll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup hate to get bogged down in details but bitch im like the dog pound with females my brain is corrupt real life hillside strangler i strangle a skanks neck til its triangular shaped but its upside down and my mouth aint gonna shut and mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck or helps you rake in the ducats i want payment in pub cause i aint tryna get in your bars like im waiting the club but if you put me in your lines im takin a cut  get a million writers inside of a room combined in it try to get every idea of every possible line to spit every punchline every combination that rhymes with it bitch a whole team cant see me theres no is

little engine gone  this concludes our danse macabre portions of the proceeding were recorded as for the rest of it im very much afraid it was all in your mind i dont intend to indulge in any postmortem if you havent been murdered i can only say better luck next time if you have been goodnight wherever you are  yeah so i guess this is what it is huh think its obvious we aint never gonna see eye to eye but its funny as much as i hate you i need you this is music to be murdered by   got a premonition i feel the end is near the beauty starts to fade the joy has turned to pain i hear the symphony playin ten thousand violins souls floating away like feathers in the wind   they said my last album i sounded bitter no i sound like a spitter who ninety percent of these hypocrites are tryna get rid of but why would i get a chip on my shoulder i was considered one time as the illest bitch im still as fly as your zipper true i just get richer but if it was ever all about skrilla then i

envisioned it fame to the point of imprisonment i just thought the shitd be different but somethin changed the minute that i got a whiff of it i started to inhale it smell it started sniffin it and it became my cocaine i just couldnt quit i just wanted a little bit then it turned me to a monster i became a hypocrite concert after concert i was rakin in the dough rollin in green had the game hemmed up like a sewing machine but i was losing my freedom ther was nowhere for me to not go and b seen and just go and be me and there was no inbetween you either loved it or hate it every cd critics gave it a three then three years later they go back and rerate it then called the slim shady lp the greatest the marshall mathers was a classic the eminem show was fantastic but encore just didnt have the caliber to match it i guess enough time just aint passed yet a couple more years that shitll be illmatic and eight years later im still at it divorced remarried a felon a father sleeping pill addict and this is real talk i feel like the incredible hulk my back has been broke and i can still walk  so be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold i said be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold   i got a letter from a fan that said hes been praying for me every day and for some reason its been weighing on my mind heavy cause i dont read every letter i get but something told me to go ahead and open it but why would someone pray for you when they dont know you you didnt pray for me when i was local and as i lay these vocals i think of all the shit i had to go through just to get to where im at ive already told you at least a thousand times in these rhymes i appreciate the prayer but ive already got god on my side and its been one hell of a ride hasnt it just watching it from a opposite standpoint man boys got to look nuts and thats the only word i can think of right now on how to describe the shit this is like a vibe you get go ahead and bop to it just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit  so be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold i said be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it cause it might just come

step to   step into my world let the lyrics lead the way its a place of escape that deviates from the everyday uh a resort of a sort its for your mind though so you relax them acts and me i let the rhyme flow uh so you can follow it chew it before you swallow it the lyric is a delicate thing you shouldnt holler it and yell it uh its  give your lyrics your all but remember one thing a weak rhyme could be your downfall uh take it from me uh uh uh cause im a hip hop authority poetry redemption is our number one priority uh a day without a rhyme is like a day without sunshine how can you unwind without a funky drum line uh i cant see it let the ken wood kick why cause rhyming is my game and the mic is like a joystick uh i never lose my lyrics sting like a hornet i get ready for help this for the town before the storm hits uh  uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh without a strong rhyme to step to   perform is eternal and in my lifetime i hope i never have to see a day without a rhyme legendary the lyrical olympian merciless and cruel i rule cause im the champion defending my position like a heavyweight fighter a dope rap writer deadly as a poisonous spider yeah no comparison the women seem mysterious my lyrics work as servants leaving listeners delirious under my hypnosis on the edge of their seat its like a science fiction movie with groovy hip hop beats so just relax and youll enjoy the double feature let my vocals take control of your soul then let the rolling reach you uh you cant ignore the dance floor anymore the rhymes are mind blowing for the fancy and the hardcore hip hop lovers who pump it as a pasttime the furthest sent from their mind a day without a rhyme   a day without a rhyme without a strong rhyme to step to a day without a rhyme without a strong rhyme to step to  floating atop a growing sea of mcs liquidating sucker rappers like a fatal disease thats right i flick lives like boogers from my fingers my assassin has my back smoking dope just like a gunslinger im just a merciless dog you know the time huh id rather die than go a day without a rhyme you see a lyric is a poets personal emotion a pocket full of holes he throws a deep devotion  is stretching keeps the roof constantly running my craftiness and cunning makes the floor  so stunning its as dumb as it can be theres not an mc who can hang with me they like to battle but they never wanna bang with me cause im a real dirty and dogmatic  in fact im just a dope rhyme fanatic i like to rock the party every time i get a chance to but on a day without a rhyme what would you dance to  but no its nothing like this the drums are death and my dj has a crisp twist larger than life dear mayor of the new school flushing rappers out like a motherfucking whirlpool bloodthirsty a witch and a boy yeah the mc destroy your boy what can i do for you you dont want me youll never survive youll be eaten alive the very second you are mine so do yourself a favour save your breath and take a step to me and youll step into the arms of death and quite frankly that will be a real slither i rarely use the  is it time to feel the flipper boy this 89 my rhymes are clicking like clockwork i need a grammy so im a piece of chalk work  entertaining you i kick fiction but dont be alarmed if you hear a contradiction that whos to say what the future might bring by the grace of allah ill just continue doing my thing creeping the math and then that constant movement but do say lyrics that can stand no improvement so yo if you were sleeping or napping or waking you know who you are i guess youre just breathtaking i write the rhyme to strike you like a lightning bolt with every finishing stroke another rap is smoke so im the deej this year the microphone musketeer this is the year of the merciless ameer word  theres no lying in my dialogue cause when i go out im going like a raw dog well this was fun i hate to break but i gotta run my homies landing on my box with the 911 see you next time but in the meantime try not to go even a single day without a rhyme  wwithout a strong rhyme to step to without a strong rhyme to step to without a strong rhyme to step to wwithout a strong rhyme to step to a day without a rhyme yeah dog that was dope  its paul uh i dont even know where the fuck you are but apparently you left out of the club two nights ago with ten plus girls and nobodys heard from you nobodys heard from the girls so if you get around to it and you think maybe its a good idea how about you give me a call and let me know what the fucks goin on thanks its the calm before the storm right here  wait how was i gonna start this off  i forgot oh yeah  thats an awfully hot coffee pot  should i drop it on donald trump probably not  but thats all i got til i come up with a solid plot  got a plan and now i gotta hatch it  like a damn apache with a tomahawk  imma walk inside a mosque on ramadan  and say a prayer that every time melania talks  she gets a mou ahh imma stop but we better give obama props  cause what we got in office nows a kamikaze  thatll probably cause a nuclear holocaust  and while the drama pops  and he waits for shit to quiet down hell just gas his plane up and fly around til the bombing stops  intensities heightened tensions ar risin  trump when it comes to giving a shit youre stingy as i am  excpt when it comes to having the balls to go against me you hide em  cause you dont got the fucking nuts like an empty asylum  racisms the only thing hes fantastic for  cause thats how he gets his fucking rocks off and hes orange  yeah sick tan  thats why he wants us to disband cause he cannot withstand  the fact were not afraid of trump  fuck walkin on egg shells i came to stomp  thats why he keeps screamin drain the swamp  cause hes in quicksand  its like we take a step forwards then backwards  but this is his form of distraction  plus he gets an enormous reaction  when he attacks the nfl so we focus on that  instead of talking puerto rico or gun reform for nevada  all these horrible tragedies and hes bored and would rather  cause a twitter storm with the packers  then says he wants to lower our taxes then whos gonna pay for his extravagant trips  back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions  same shit that he tormented hillary for and he slandered  then does it more  from his endorsement of bannon  support for the klansmen  tiki torches in hand for the soldier thats black  and comes home from iraq  and is still told to go back to africa  fork and a dagger in this racist 94yearold grandpa  who keeps ignoring our past historical deplorable factors  now if youre a black athlete youre a spoiled little brat for  tryna use your platform or your stature  to try to give those a voice who dont have one  he says youre spittin in the face of vets who fought for us you bastards  unless youre a pow whos tortured and battered  cause to him youre zeros  cause he dont like his war heroes captured  thats not disrespecting the military  fuck that this is for colin ball up a fist  and keep that shit balled like donald the bitch  hes gonna get rid of all immigrants  hes gonna build that thang up taller than this  well if he does build it i hope its rock solid with bricks  cause like him in politics im using all of his tricks  cause im throwin that piece of shit against the wall til it sticks  and any fan of mine whos a supporter of his  im drawing in the sand a line youre either for or against  and if you cant decide who you like more and youre split  on who you should stand beside ill do it for you with this  fuck you  the rest of america stand up  we love our military and we love our country  but we fuckin hate trump   if i could rewind time like a tape inside a boombox  one day for every pill or percocet that i ate  cut down on the valium ida heard everything  but death is turning so definitewait  they got me all hooked up to some machine  i love you bean didnt want you to know

hearttoheart honest and open talk with you  doody i see you i go to walk to you  and i can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room  nurses lean over the bed pulling tubes out  then the
